# cam2pdf

Bash script to make PDF's using from your camera roll (Android)

## Usage

With your Android phone mounted, run:

```
$ ./cam2pdf.sh
```

This will take all of the pictures from your camera roll (taken that day) and convert them to a pdf.

## Todo

- [ ] Allow quality to be adjustable
- [ ] More robust image sourcing
- [ ] Allow for re-ordering of images once copied
- [ ] Fix too many images causing `convert` to fail
